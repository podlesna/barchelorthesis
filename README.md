This bachelor thesis deals with the design of the method for solving the
curse of dimensionality arising in the quantitative modeling of complex interconnected
systems. The employed predictive models are based on a discrete Markov process.
Prediction is based on estimating model parameters using Bayesian statistics. This
work contains method for reducing the amount of data needed for prediction in
systems with a large number of occurring states and actions. Instead of estimating
a predictor dependent on all parameters, the method assumes the use of several
predictors, which arise from estimating parametric models based on dependences on
different regressors. The behavioral properties of the proposed method are illustrated
by simulation experiments
